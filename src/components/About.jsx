              Before university, I attended Ralston High School, where I was
              involved in band, robotics, and the honor society. After receiving
              my diploma in 2020, I enrolled at the University of Nebraska Omaha
              to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science. In the fall of
              2022, I transferred to the University of Nebraska Lincoln, where I
              am continuing my studies. I am expected to graduate in December
              2024 and plan to continue my education to earn a master's degree
              in computer science by December 2025 through an accelerated
              program.

                During my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects like
                this website. Outside of programming, I like to play tennis,
                hang out with friends, and take pictures of the night sky, also
                known as astrophotography. You can find my photos on
                Instagram&nbsp;

                . I'm also a big fan of music; I play guitar, piano, and
                saxophone. In high school, I was part of a quartet that
                performed the national anthem at a Storm Chasers baseball game.
                This semester, Iâ€™ll be getting back into music by participating
